console.log("Lakshya")

//so that is how you kinda print in javascript ,
/*
now you might wonder : Q) is console a class or something and is log a function , yeah i know previous knowledge 
kicks in lol !! , 
so to answer it -> console is actually an object knows as built in "global object" ( i think we will see about it later so hold ur horses my dear)
and YEAH log is a function or should i say method ( it is actually inside the console object)
*/

//as we start this language we might have few question , i mean given we know a 
// lil programming

//so fear not just ask and lets tackle those question TOGETHER !!!! HEHE
/*
Q): who is the inventor or javascript and when?
ANS): so we just got cool answer to it , "BRENDAN EICH" created this language in "1995"
      and the best thing is that he just created it in 10 days , to add more interactivity 
      to webpages , while working at netscape. 
      Firstly it was named "Mocha" and then "Livescript" and then finally "Javascript"


Q): So is it an interpretted language or compiled language?
ANS): so javascript or js is actually an interpretted language 

Q):Is javascript a case sensetive language?
ANS): Absolutely javascript is a case sensetive language,
      that is it is affected by different way of writing like
       upper case and lower case are different for it
       eg: Name and name are two different things not same


Q): Is javascript a dynamically typed language?
ANS): Yep !! just like python it is also a dynamically typed language,
      that is we do not have to explicitly write the type of any variable 
      (we will discuss about everything dont worry)

        I THINK THIS MUCH IS ENOUGH FOR TODAY WE WILL MEET IN OTHER BASICS !!

                    BYE !!                             BYE!!
